# Typecho-Terminal-Theme
A terminal styled, minimal typecho theme inspired by and based on Terminal CSS

# Installation
1. Put the "assets" folder in the httpdocs directory.
2. Put the "terminal" folder in the httpdocs/usr/themes directory.

# Development
I'm not very familiar with frontend or theme development.
I have created the theme in order to use it on my blog and I don't think I'll update it soon.
If you like the theme and want to improve it, you can commit your changes.
